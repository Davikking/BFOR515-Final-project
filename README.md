By analyzing the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Restaurant Inspection data, which is available though the NYSDOH Open Data Portal, we have addressed the need to enhance public health and safety. In addressing the need to enhance public health and safety we have identified key attributes such as number of critical violations as well as final scores and grades on inspections. These attributes have allowed us to view the level of safety by county in New York State as well as predicting the anticipated scores and grades using different analytical tools. 

Current Progress:

- Completed Data Cleaning - excluded any records with missing critical info, identified and addressed missing/null entries, removed duplicates, ensured all attributes were in the correct data types

- Heat Maps - Utilized Heat maps to assess the number of critical violations by county within New York State

- Decision tree - Based on the data we have available we were able to train our machine learning algorithm to predict the grade of a restaurant based on total critical violations as well as the inspection score
 
- K-Means Clustering - Used K-means clustering to group data points into clusters based on their similarities. using this strategy we were able to highlight groups that are consistently performing poorly on inspections as well as view relationships between critical violations, scores and grades.

Next Steps:

In the coming weeks we will be finalizing our project. Given the analytical tools we have used we will analyze our model results to identify significant patterns relating to high risk areas, and the relationships between critical violations, scores and grades. 

Following our analysis of our models we will compile our findngs into a comprehensive report. In this report we will address our methodologies, our results and the recommendations based on our results. 

We will then create a presentation where we can detail our key insights and the public health implications.
